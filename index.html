Dear Javascript enthusiasts,

we are pleased to announce a new Javascript mailing list:

    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/js-tools">http://groups.google.com/group/js-tools</a>

-----------------------------------------------------------
- are you working on some great Javascript tools?

- are you looking for a Javascript development tool?

- do you wish that tools X and Z could be used together?

- have you invested time building tool T on top of tool A,
   only to find the A has been abandoned and everyone
   else has moved on to tool B, without telling you?

- would you like to see the various individual development
   efforts feed into collaborative development projects, to
   improve interoperability and maintenance?

- are you looking for collaborators to revive an open-source
    tool that its original authors no longer have time for?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Join js-tools and help moving Javascript developer tools
forward!-) It is a forum for Javascript tool developers and
others who wish they knew where to find tool information.

    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/js-tools/about">http://groups.google.com/group/js-tools/about</a>

    JavaScript Development Tools. Tools for JavaScript;
    tools in JavaScript. Discovering and integrating existing
    tools; implementation of new tools; shared tooling
    infrastructure; needed tools; research on tools and tool
    users.

There is a companion github repo for the group at

    <a href="http://clausreinke.github.com/js-tools/">http://clausreinke.github.com/js-tools/</a>

The repo has a longer description of why I think this group
is needed, and it holds a list of tool resources that we hope
to grow as Javascript tool developers start using js-tools
as a place to announce their tools.

On behalf of the js-tools team,

Claus Reinke
